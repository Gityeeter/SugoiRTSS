Overlay program for Sugoi Japanese Translator <br/>

-> Usage <-

-> Install rivatuner server from here -> https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download.html

-> Download the Sugoi Japanese translator from here -> https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgj_SgsiVnsnMIIWsXO9lrA

-> Download SugoiRTSS from releases

-> Navigate to your sugoi translator folder and go to Sugoi-Japanese-Translator-V2.5\backendServer\Program-Backend\Sugoi-Translator-DeepL (I've tested it with deepl, but should work with others too)

-> Extract the downloaded rar file in the Sugoi-Translator-DeepL folder. When asked to replace translationFilter.js, click yes.

-> Now run rivatuner statistics server

-> Then open your VN and hook it using textractor(or any other program) and launch sugoi translator

-> Now launch SugoiRTSS.exe from the same folder.

-> Sugoi's text will be mirrored in the VN via OSD even in fullscreen.

If you want the change the size of the font or color, you can do so by double clicking the rivatuner icon in the system tray. You can also move the translation around by using the arrow keys in fullscreen.
